NOT CURRENTLY INSTALLED WITH CURRENT SETUP

This is an interesting app.  No intention of reinstalling app.  
It is meant to replace the menu bar on MacOS
However, on newer versions of macOS you cannot perm hide it, nor replace it.  
You can only "autohide" it.  So it will reappear every time you navigate to the top of the screen.
This will perm place something at the top of the screen as an app.
However, it will not "autohide" ever.  And if you navigate / mouse over it, macOS will usually drop down the regular menu.  This is obnoxious.
This looks cool enough though, and there is some config here.
